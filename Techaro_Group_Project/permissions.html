            <p>Sets that represent different levels of ownership: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Owner or user permissions: after directory (d) slot,  the first set of three characters indicate permission settings for the owner
                    Examples: </li>
                <li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>-rw-r--r--, the owner permissions are rw-, indicating that the owner can read and write to the file but can't execute it as a program.</li>
                        <li>drwxr-xr-x, the owner permissions are rwx, indicating that the owner can view, modify, and enter the directory</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Group permissions: The second rwx set indicates the group permissions
                    Examples:  </li>
                <li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>-rw-r--r--, group members can only read the file.</li>
                        <li>drwxr-xr-x, group members can view as well as enter the directory</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>3.	Other permissions: The final rwx set is for "other" (sometimes referred to as "world"). This is anyone outside the group. </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Change Permissions</h2>
            <p>To modify file and directory permissions on a Unix-like operating system, you can use the chmod (change mode) command. The chmod command allows you to change the permissions for the owner of a file or directory (represented by "u"), the group owner of a file or directory (represented by "g"), or other users on the system (represented by "o").You can add (+) or subtract (-) read, write, and execute permissions for each of these categories.</p>
            <p>SYMBOLIC METHOD- lets you specify permissions with single letter abbreviations. A chmod command using this method consists of at least three parts from the following lists:</p>
            <!-- Make a 3 x 4 box -->
            <div>
                <!--Access class-->
                <div>
                    <div>Access class</div>
                    <div>u (user)</div>
                    <div>g (group)</div>
                    <div>o (other)</div>
                    <div>a (all: u, g, and o)</div>
                </div>
                <!--Operator-->
                <div>
                    <div>Operator</div>
                    <div>+ (add access)</div>
                    <div>- (remove access)</div>
                    <div>= (set exact access)</div>
                </div>
                <!--Access Type-->
                <div>
                    <div>Access Type</div>
                    <div>r (read)</div>
                    <div>w (write)</div>
                    <div>x (execute)</div>
                </div>


                <p>e.g  to add permission for everyone to read a file in the current directory named myfile, at the Unix prompt, enter:</p>
                <p>chmod a+r myfile</p>
                <p>a stands for "all", the + for "add", and the r for "read".</p>
